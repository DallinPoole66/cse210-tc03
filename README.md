CSE210 Team Challenge 03

Braxton Meyer
	I grew up in Boise, Idaho, have 5 brothers, served a mission in Boston, Massachusetts, and love video games.
	My first major was Mechanical Engineering, but I just switched to Software Engineering, and I am having
	a much better time with it. So far all I've got in terms of experience is an introductory C++ course I
	took before the mission, and all the python and javascript I've been able to get this first semester.

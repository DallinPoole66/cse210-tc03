<h2>Eli</h2>
<p>
Hi, as the header states I'm Eil. I've been coding since I was about 7-8 and I spend too much of my time doing it. 
I'm currenly working for the VR startup Megadodo simulation games as the lead game dev. 
I've also been runing the VR tutorial website wirewhiz.com for about 3-4 years.

<h2>Braxton Meyer</h2>
<p>
I grew up in Boise, Idaho, have 5 brothers, served a mission in Boston, Massachusetts, and love video games.
My first major was Mechanical Engineering, but I just switched to Software Engineering, and I am having
a much better time with it. So far all I've got in terms of experience is an introductory C++ course I
took before the mission, and all the python and javascript I've been able to get this first semester.

This is my biography paragraph. I'm from Texas, I've worked as an EMT in

I'm a Software Engineering major and have no idea what I'm doing with my life.

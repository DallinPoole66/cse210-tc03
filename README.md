Braxton Meyer
	I grew up in Boise, Idaho, have 5 brothers, served a mission in Boston, Massachusetts, and love video games.
	My first major was Mechanical Engineering, but I just switched to Software Engineering, and I am having
	a much better time with it. So far all I've got in terms of experience is an introductory C++ course I
	took before the mission, and all the python and javascript I've been able to get this first semester.

Dallin Poole

This is my biography paragraph. I'm from Texas, I've worked as an EMT in
Austin TX. I speak a decent amount of Farsi and a bit less Arabic. 
I'm a Software Engineering major and have no idea what I'm doing with my life.
